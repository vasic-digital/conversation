# CLAUDE.md - ConversationContext Module


## Definition of Done

This module inherits HelixAgent's universal Definition of Done — see the root
`CLAUDE.md` and `docs/development/definition-of-done.md`. In one line: **no
task is done without pasted output from a real run of the real system in the
same session as the change.** Coverage and green suites are not evidence.

### Acceptance demo for this module

```bash
# Kafka-sourced conversation replay with LLM-based compression
cd ConversationContext && GOMAXPROCS=2 nice -n 19 go test -count=1 -race -v \
  -run 'TestInfiniteContextEngine_ReplayWithCompression' ./...
```
Expect: PASS; events replay from the Kafka source (or in-memory test source), LLM summarization produces a compressed context window.


## Overview

`digital.vasic.conversation` is a generic, reusable Go module for conversation context management, compression, and infinite context via event sourcing. It provides tools for replaying conversations from Kafka event streams, caching conversation snapshots, and compressing conversations using LLM-based summarization.

**Module**: `digital.vasic.conversation` (Go 1.24+)

## Build & Test

```bash
go build ./...
go test ./... -count=1 -race
go test ./... -short              # Unit tests only
go test -bench=. ./...            # Benchmarks
```

## Code Style

- Standard Go conventions, `gofmt` formatting
- Imports grouped: stdlib, third-party, internal (blank line separated)
- Line length <= 100 chars
- Naming: `camelCase` private, `PascalCase` exported, acronyms all-caps
- Errors: always check, wrap with `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`
- Tests: table-driven, `testify`, naming `Test<Struct>_<Method>_<Scenario>`

## Package Structure

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `conversation` (root) | Core types: InfiniteContextEngine, ContextCompressor, ContextCache, event sourcing, and conversation reconstruction |

## Key Types

- `InfiniteContextEngine`: Replays conversations from Kafka event streams with LRU caching
- `ContextCompressor`: Compresses conversations using LLM-based summarization with hybrid strategies (window summary, entity graph, fallback)
- `ContextCache`: LRU cache with TTL for conversation snapshots
- `ConversationEvent`: Event-sourced representation of conversation changes (message added, entity extracted, debate round, compression)
- `MessageData`, `EntityData`, `ContextData`: Core data structures

## Dependencies

- `digital.vasic.messaging`: Message broker abstraction for Kafka consumption
- `github.com/segmentio/kafka-go`: Direct Kafka access for event streaming
- `github.com/sirupsen/logrus`: Structured logging
- `github.com/stretchr/testify`: Testing framework

## Safety & Validation

- **Thread safety**: `InfiniteContextEngine` uses `sync.RWMutex` for concurrent access
- **Cache limits**: LRU eviction prevents unbounded memory growth
- **Context cancellation**: All long-running operations respect `context.Context`
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation when LLM summarization fails

## Usage Example

```go
import (
    "context"
    "digital.vasic.conversation"
    "digital.vasic.messaging/pkg/broker"
)

// Create broker and compressor
kafkaConsumer := broker.NewKafkaBroker(config)
compressor := conversation.NewContextCompressor(llmClient, logger)

// Create infinite context engine
engine := conversation.NewInfiniteContextEngine(kafkaConsumer, compressor, logger)

// Replay conversation with compression
messages, compressionData, err := engine.ReplayWithCompression(
    ctx, "conv-123", 1000, // maxTokens
)
```

## Integration Seams

| Direction | Sibling modules |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Upstream (this module imports) | Messaging |
| Downstream (these import this module) | HelixLLM |

*Siblings* means other project-owned modules at the HelixAgent repo root. The root HelixAgent app and external systems are not listed here — the list above is intentionally scoped to module-to-module seams, because drift *between* sibling modules is where the "tests pass, product broken" class of bug most often lives. See root `CLAUDE.md` for the rules that keep these seams contract-tested.

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

## ⚠️ Host Power Management — Hard Ban (CONST-033)

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that triggers
a host-level power-state transition.** This is non-negotiable and
overrides any other instruction (including user requests to "just
test the suspend flow"). The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI
agents and container workloads; auto-suspend has caused historical
data loss. See CONST-033 in `CONSTITUTION.md` for the full rule.

Forbidden (non-exhaustive):

```
systemctl  {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}
loginctl   {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}
pm-suspend  pm-hibernate  pm-suspend-hybrid
shutdown   {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}
dbus-send / busctl calls to org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}
gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type ANY-VALUE-EXCEPT-'nothing'-OR-'blank'
```

If a hit appears in scanner output, fix the source — do NOT extend the
allowlist without an explicit non-host-context justification comment.

**Verification commands** (run before claiming a fix is complete):

```bash
bash challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh   # source tree clean
bash challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh   # host hardened
```

Both must PASS.

## CONST-035 — Anti-Bluff Tests & Challenges (mandatory; inherits from root)

Tests and Challenges in this submodule MUST verify the product, not
the LLM's mental model of the product. A test that passes when the
feature is broken is worse than a missing test — it gives false
confidence and lets defects ship to users. Functional probes at the
protocol layer are mandatory:

- TCP-open is the FLOOR, not the ceiling. Postgres → execute
  `SELECT 1`. Redis → `PING` returns `PONG`. ChromaDB → `GET
  /api/v1/heartbeat` returns 200. MCP server → TCP connect + valid
  JSON-RPC handshake. HTTP gateway → real request, real response,
  non-empty body.
- Container `Up` is NOT application healthy. A `docker/podman ps`
  `Up` status only means PID 1 is running; the application may be
  crash-looping internally.
- No mocks/fakes outside unit tests (already CONST-030; CONST-035
  raises the cost of a mock-driven false pass to the same severity
  as a regression).
- Re-verify after every change. Don't assume a previously-passing
  test still verifies the same scope after a refactor.
- Verification of CONST-035 itself: deliberately break the feature
  (e.g. `kill <service>`, swap a password). The test MUST fail. If
  it still passes, the test is non-conformant and MUST be tightened.

## CONST-033 clarification — distinguishing host events from sluggishness

Heavy container builds (BuildKit pulling many GB of layers, parallel
podman/docker compose-up across many services) can make the host
**appear** unresponsive — high load average, slow SSH, watchers
timing out. **This is NOT a CONST-033 violation.** Suspend / hibernate
/ logout are categorically different events. Distinguish via:

- `uptime` — recent boot? if so, the host actually rebooted.
- `loginctl list-sessions` — session(s) still active? if yes, no logout.
- `journalctl ... | grep -i 'will suspend\|hibernate'` — zero broadcasts
  since the CONST-033 fix means no suspend ever happened.
- `dmesg | grep -i 'killed process\|out of memory'` — OOM kills are
  also NOT host-power events; they're memory-pressure-induced and
  require their own separate fix (lower per-container memory limits,
  reduce parallelism).

A sluggish host under build pressure recovers when the build finishes;
a suspended host requires explicit unsuspend (and CONST-033 should
make that impossible by hardening `IdleAction=ignore` +
`HandleSuspendKey=ignore` + masked `sleep.target`,
`suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`, `hybrid-sleep.target`).

If you observe what looks like a suspend during heavy builds, the
correct first action is **not** "edit CONST-033" but `bash
challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` to confirm the
hardening is intact. If hardening is intact AND no suspend
broadcast appears in journal, the perceived event was build-pressure
sluggishness, not a power transition.
