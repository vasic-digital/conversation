# host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh — CONST-033 reproduction guard.
#
# Asserts the host this challenge runs on cannot be suspended /
# hibernated / put into hybrid-sleep by any user, session, DE, greeter,
# or cron job. Defence in depth: target masking + sleep.conf override
# + logind IdleAction override.
#
# Self-contained — no framework.sh dependency. Drop-in for any project's
# challenges/scripts/ directory.
#
# Pass criteria (4 assertions):
#   1. systemctl is-enabled sleep.target / suspend.target /
#      hibernate.target / hybrid-sleep.target ALL == "masked"
#   2. AllowSuspend=no found in /etc/systemd/sleep.conf or any
#      /etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/*.conf drop-in
#   3. logind IdleAction == "ignore" (or unset, which defaults to ignore)
#   4. journalctl shows no "The system will suspend now" events since
#      the fix marker (/etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d/00-no-suspend.conf)
#      was written
#
# Exit:
#   0 = all 4 PASS
#   1 = one or more FAIL
#   2 = invocation error
